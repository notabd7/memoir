//TODO:
//phase 1
//set up  .env and open ai model
// take permission from user to access camera and gallery to upload 
//or add an image
//next send that image to 4-o with the following prompt
//"describe this person to an animator so that they are able to draw the person as a anime type animation!"
//then we get the description from gpt4-o and then we send that description
// to dalle 3 and get the image it generates
// we display this image on our screen
//this is the main character off our manga
//phase 2
//now next we prompt user to add their closest people
//we will have a button to add a person this will bring up
a prompt to add the `name` and the picture of the person theyre 
closest too, we will store the picture asssocisted with the name 
and make images for each.
these are the characters for our manga 

Phase 3
getting the script 
we will get a script from the user, that script will be sent to 
gpt4o, we will structure that api call in away that we filter out
pieces of the script that are best to formulate a short 2 page manga
, gpt 4o will be prompted again then to describe each image fram in the manga
seperately, we will get those images. concurrent requests will be sent
for faster processing. wwe will get those images with numbered labels,
so we know which image to fit where. 
we will already have a skeleton for the manga where we will be populating those images
and thats our manga

for storage I want to use firebase to store users account (will be using google auth)
and we will store the closest people they entered with their images
and we will store the manga they generate every time given the script
for now this is the current plan lets start in phases, testing and developing before we move on
